        <br>
        <li>1/4 cup milk or half-and-half</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

    <h2>Instruction:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chopped potatoes in a large pot and add enough cold water to cover them. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the butter, salt, and pepper, and mash the potatoes with a potato masher or a fork until they're mostly smooth.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Gradually add the milk, stirring to combine, until the potatoes reach your desired consistency. You may not need all of the milk, so add it slowly and be prepared to stop adding it when the potatoes are smooth and creamy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If you want to add extra flavor, now's the time to stir in some garlic powder, chives, or grated cheese.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve the mashed potatoes hot, garnished with chopped chives or scallions if desired.Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
